            <p>The data set is 16k results of randomly selected Github archive data, <span title="FollowEvent, ForkEvent, ForkApplyEvent, IssueCommentEvent, IssuesEvent, MemberEvent, PullRequestEvent, PullRequestReviewCommentEvent, PushEvent, WatchEvent" style="border-bottom:1px dotted #999">selected by events</span>.</p>
            <p><strong>Things you should know</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>This data set is limited to 16k rows.. why? Because Google BigQuery wanted me to pay for more.</li>
                <li>The selection was random, and there's no additional meta data attached; only repo name and user name.. why? Because Google wanted me to pay for more.</li>
                <li>Built using neo4j and ruby, primarily to find out exactly what neo4j does. Graphs obviously.</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Graphs</h2>
            <a href="nodes.html"><h3>Node connections</h3></a>
            <p>Shows all the connections between users and repositories. Data set contains 3843 nodes, and 3269 links... so is quite intensive to load.</p>
            <a href="longest.html"><h3>Longest path</h3></a>
            <p>Find the longest path in the graph.</p>
